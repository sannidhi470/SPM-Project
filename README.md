# SOEN 6841: Software Project Management
## Course Project - Group 4
## Application Domain - Financial Literacy App

## Description

In this project, we will take on the role of project managers and propose an innovative software solution to address a real-world problem or capitalize on an emerging opportunity in the realm of Financial Literacy. The project will involve the following key components:

### Problem/Opportunity Statement

In the evolving world of financial education, a significant problem remains due to the existing gap in effectively connecting financial institutions with widely used financial apps. This gap prevents current applications from delivering real-time transaction data, limiting their ability to provide users with targeted insights and instructive content. Recognizing this constraint, our project takes a proactive approach by delivering a comprehensive software solution that aims to overcome this gap.

The proposed solution strategically leverages links with financial institutions, enabling seamless integration. This integration extends beyond traditional functions, including real-time transaction analysis, individualized budgeting guidance, and customized financial goal monitoring. Furthermore, the solution incorporates interactive learning tools, which improves the user experience while tackling the overall issue of insufficient financial literacy.

Our project's goal is to provide consumers with realistic, real-world insights suited to their financial patterns by including these revolutionary elements. The software solution's individualized financial education courses and goal-specific guidance pave the way for more informed and engaged users. The ultimate goal is not just to close the gap between financial institutions and financial apps but also to promote a thorough awareness of financial behaviors, allowing users to make informed decisions, establish realistic goals, and confidently navigate their financial journeys.
